* Support DESTDIR as way to build deployable package
  - don't modify statefile when DESTDIR is set unless DESTDIR is ~/.perl6/
  - envvar to use a different statefile?
* Open GitHub issues:
  - #4:  Fix fetcher.t to silence (expected) Git error message
  - #12: Error checking for Ecosystem::update
  - #16: Fuzzy match misspelled modules (wrong case, small edit distance, etc.)
    . Always try exact match first
* Keep track of the installed files so they can be removed later
  - it's tricky if they're installed to some DESTDIR
* Retain --notests and --nodeps setting in statefile, so that rebootstrap
  can survive rebuilding projects that require these settings
* Merge with panda-niecza?
* Update README.md to represent current reality
* Quick way to git submodule foreach git pull origin master
